# Contributing to GlobaLeaks
As many open source projects, GlobaLeaks benefits from the volunteer effort of the community.

The more the help, the better is the software, its localization and its documentation.

We'd love for you to contribute to GlobaLeaks and help us making it even better than it is today!

You can contribute to GlobaLeaks in different and all welcomed ways:

## Supporting us with your development skills!
To learn how to be part in the GlobaLeaks development read our [software development guidelines](https://github.com/globaleaks/GlobaLeaks/wiki#software-development).

## Translating the software in your language!
GlobaLeaks is currently localized and internationalized in [more than 20 languages](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/globaleaks/).

The work on translation is performed in collaboration with the [Localization Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org) and with help of the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/globaleaks/) volunteers community.

To read more on how translation is performed and you you could help on this side visit the [Localization Lab guidelines](http://www.localizationlab.org/translator-getting-started-guide).

## Spotting security flaws and partecipating to our Bug Bounting Program!
Anonymous whistleblowing can be easy and secure.

Unfortunately, no technology is perfect and GlobaLeaks believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying software weaknesses.

While we do our best to provide a secure software by default, security vulnerabilities and new attack techniques must be taken into account. If you believe you've found a security issue in the Globaleaks framework codebase, we encourage you to participate in the [GlobaLeaks bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/globaleaks) hosted by [Hackerone](https://hackerone.com/globaleaks).
